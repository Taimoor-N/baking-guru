# Baking Guru
This app fetches baking recipes in JSON format and displays recipe ingredients and the preparation steps (with videos).

App includes the following components:
* Room database to store recipes.
* Exoplayer to display videos for recipe steps (with fullscreen playback option).
* Espresso tests for UI testing.
* Widget to display ingredients for the most recently selected recipe.
* Master/Detail flow with Fragments to create a responsive design that works well with both phones and tablets.

This is one of my projects for the [Android Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) course on Udacity.
